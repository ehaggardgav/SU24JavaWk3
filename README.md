In this assignment, you'll be creating a gradebook.

1. Request the user to enter the names of all of their students until they enter 'x.' Store the names of the students in a dynamic array (i.e. your program must be able to handle any number of students) and use a loop.

2. Remove one of the students from the roster (your choice).

3. Ask the user to enter the grades for exam 1 (for each student) into a grades array (you are free to use a 1D, 2D, or dynamic array). But you must use a loop.

4. Iterate over the grades array (using a loop) and output the average exam 1 score.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to store the results of exam 2 and the exam 3 (and print out the average for both).

6. Calculate the final numerical grade for each student using the following weighting: 20% Exam 1, 30% Exam 2, 50% Exam 3. Print out the average final grade.

Example:

Please enter the name of each student. Type 'x' to quit.

Student 1: Amy
Student 2: Tamy
Student 3: Jamy
Student 4: Bill
Student 5: x

Jamy was removed from roster.
